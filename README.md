# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates.

This project presents an end-to-end **machine learning–based diagnostic system** to classify breast tumours as **benign** or **malignant** using clinical features from the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD) dataset**.

The project was developed as part of a **Python and Machine Learning Internship** and focuses on building an accurate, interpretable, and reliable prediction pipeline suitable for healthcare decision-support systems.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD) Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Features:** 30 numerical diagnostic features
- **Target Classes:**
  - `0` → Benign
  - `1` → Malignant

The dataset contains measurements computed from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei.

⚠️ **Note:**  
The dataset file (`data.csv`) is required to run the notebook.  
Ensure it is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

### Programming & Environment
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab

### Libraries
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SHAP (Explainable AI)

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removal of non-informative columns
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Skewness correction using log transformations
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Multicollinearity reduction using correlation analysis and VIF

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Diagnosis Distribution
The dataset shows a slightly imbalanced distribution between benign and malignant cases.


#### Feature Correlation Analysis
A correlation heatmap was used to identify highly correlated features and reduce redundancy.

### 3. Model Development
The following supervised learning models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM – RBF kernel)

Each model was trained using an 80/20 stratified train–test split and evaluated using standard performance metrics.

---

### 4. Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Chi-Square Test

PCA reduced the feature space from 30 to 9 components while preserving approximately **95% of the total variance**.

---

### 5. Model Evaluation

#### Confusion Matrix
Confusion matrices were used to evaluate classification performance for each model.

### 6. Explainable AI (XAI)
To ensure interpretability and transparency, **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** was applied.

Key influential features identified include:
- `concavity_worst`
- `concave_points_mean`
- `radius_mean`
- `texture_mean`
